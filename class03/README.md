## Second Hands On: extend the power of a data science platform with your own code

Through another data science use case, students will analyze, clean and enrich their data with Dataiku DSS and additional coding capacities including Python and SQL. The idea will be to work with technologies students already know to get new insights and visualizations.  

**Our Use case**: FICO  
In this project, the analyst is working in a lending company. The company has information about customers (customer information) and wants to assess the likelihood of default on the loan granted.  

**Side note**: What is FICO?  
As a matter of clarity, the FICO score given in the customer information database is an evaluation of the credit score of the customer. It has been purchased from the FICO company.  

## Content

We will follow the same walkthrough as for the _Titanic_ use case to start the project and import our data.  
On the way, we will discover coding capabilities in Dataiku with Python and SQL. We will use notebooks and coding recipes to explore and process our data.  

In the very end, we will train and deploy our model and we will access our model as a notebook to better understand how Dataiku leverages the `scikit-learn` open source library.
